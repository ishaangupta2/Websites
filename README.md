Here you can see my code: [https://github.com/ishaangupta2/Websites](https://github.com/ishaangupta2/Websites) and this is the live version of it on GitHub Pages: [https://ishaangupta2.github.io/Websites/](https://ishaangupta2.github.io/Websites/)

this is the root, or very base of my website folder. 

if you see this on a url that looks like 

ishaangupta2.github.io/Websites/

then you can append project/website/folder names to the url to get
to the actual webpage
